RSHiscores
==========

A MediaWiki extension that provides easy access to RuneScape's Hiscores for use in wikitext and JS calculators. Originally designed for the RuneScape Wiki at http://runescape.wikia.com.

Please see http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/User:Catcrewser/RSHiscores details.

Please make your issues and pull requests here, but see http://github.com/Wikia/app/tree/dev/extensions/3rdparty/RSHighscores for the version live at Wikia (and the RuneScape Wiki).
Due to Wikia's update cycles the live version might be older than what appears here. See the 'wikia' branch for the currently submitted version.
